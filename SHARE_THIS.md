Excited to share my latest project: A secure AI agent distribution platform!

🔐 Key Innovation:
- Protected prompts (IP stays safe)
- One-line install
- Simple slash commands
- Built on Claude's MCP

Installation takes 30 seconds:

Title: Show HN: One-Line AI Agent Installer with Prompt Protection

I built a system to distribute AI agents via Claude's Model Context Protocol while keeping system prompts secure on the server.

Key features:
- One-line bash installer
- Slash commands for easy use (/react-expert, /sql-debug)
- Guardrails prevent prompt extraction
- Works in Claude Code

Try it:
bash <(curl -fsSL [URL])

Looking for feedback on:
1. Security model
2. Distribution approach
3. Business model ideas

Code: [GitHub link when ready]
```

### Discord/Slack
```
🎉 Hey everyone! I built something cool - AI agents you can install in one command!

Installation:
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://julien-semimanneristic-eugene.ngrok-free.dev/install)
```

What you get:
• /react-expert - React/TS help
• /sql-debug - SQL optimization
• /agents - See all available agents

The cool part: Prompts stay hidden on my server so they can't be copied!

Try it out and let me know what you think! 🚀
