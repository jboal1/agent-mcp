```

### Direct Tool Calls (Advanced)
For more control, call tools directly:

**Single Agent:**
```
Use mcp__agent-mcp__agent_run with:
- agent_id: react-expert
- user_input: Review this useEffect hook for memory leaks
```

**Complete Workflows:**
```
Use mcp__agent-mcp__review_code_complete with:
- code: [paste your code or describe the file]
```

```
Use mcp__agent-mcp__debug_complete with:
- error: ReferenceError: fetchData is not defined
```

```
Use mcp__agent-mcp__build_feature_complete with:
- feature: Add user authentication with JWT tokens

## Why No Slash Commands?

Slash commands create visual noise (tool execution blocks). By removing them, you get:

‚úÖ **Clean UI** - No approval blocks or collapsed tool calls
‚úÖ **Natural Flow** - Just describe your problem
‚úÖ **Auto-Routing** - Claude Code picks the right agent
‚úÖ **Speed** - No extra keystrokes or approvals

This matches how agents work in Claude Desktop - mention what you need, get expert help instantly.

## Tips for Best Results

### For Code Reviews
- Share the file path: `Review src/components/UserProfile.tsx`
- Or paste code directly if it's short
- Be specific: "Review for accessibility" vs "Review this"

### For Debugging
- Include the full error message
- Share relevant code context
- Mention what you've already tried

### For Features
- Describe the user-facing behavior first
- Mention any technical constraints
- Ask for tests if you want them included

### For SQL Performance
- Share the query AND table structure
- Mention row counts if known
- Include the execution plan if available

## Advanced: Server-Side Orchestration

The workflow agents run **multiple specialists in parallel** on the server:

**Code Review** = React Expert + Test Gen + Debug This (simultaneous)
**Debug Flow** = Debug This ‚Üí SQL Debugger ‚Üí Test Gen (sequential)
**Build Feature** = React Expert ‚Üí Test Gen ‚Üí Git Helper (sequential)

You see a single clean response with synthesized insights from all agents.
