### MCP Server (Railway)
- **Production URL:** https://agent-mcp-production.up.railway.app
- **Health Check:** https://agent-mcp-production.up.railway.app/health
- **SSE Endpoint:** https://agent-mcp-production.up.railway.app/sse

### Install Script (Railway)
- **One-Line Installer:** https://agent-mcp-production.up.railway.app/install
- **Repository:** https://github.com/jboal1/agent-mcp

---

## 🚀 Share This With Anyone

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://agent-mcp-production.up.railway.app/install)
```

That's it! Anyone can run that command to:
1. Add your MCP server to their Claude Code
2. Install the `/react-expert`, `/sql-debug`, and `/agents` slash commands
3. Start using your AI agents immediately

---

## What You've Built

✅ **Remote MCP Server** on Railway (free tier)
✅ **Two AI Agents:**
   - `react-expert` - React/TypeScript expert
   - `sql-debugger` - SQL query optimizer
✅ **Slash Commands** for Claude Code
✅ **One-Line Installer** hosted on GitHub Pages
✅ **Guardrails** to prevent prompt extraction
✅ **Auto-scaling** production deployment

---

## Cost Breakdown

- Railway: **$0/month** (free tier, $5 credits)
- GitHub Pages: **$0/month** (free for public repos)
- Domain (optional): **$12/year**

**Total:** $0/month for production MVP 🎉

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

### 1. Monitor Usage
```bash
railway logs --tail 100
```

### 2. Add More Agents
Create new `.yaml` files in `src/agents/`:
```yaml
id: your-agent
version: v1
title: Your Agent Name
desc: What it does
price: 0
tags: [tag1, tag2]
system: |
  Your system prompt here
```

Then rebuild and redeploy:
```bash
git add src/agents/your-agent.v1.yaml
git commit -m "Add new agent"
git push
```

Railway will auto-deploy!

### 3. Custom Domain (Later)
1. Buy domain: `agent-mcp.dev` ($12/year)
2. In Railway: Settings → Domains → Add Custom Domain
3. Update DNS: CNAME → `agent-mcp-production.up.railway.app`
4. Update install.sh with new URL
5. You now have: `https://agent-mcp.dev/install.sh`

### 4. Analytics (Later)
Track how many people use your installer:
- Add Google Analytics to GitHub Pages
- Add logging to Railway
- Monitor via Railway dashboard

---

## How to Update

### Update Code:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push
```

Railway auto-deploys within 2 minutes!

### Update Agents:
Just edit the `.yaml` files and push. No other changes needed.

### Update Install Script:
Edit `install.sh` and push. GitHub Pages updates in 1-2 minutes.

---

## Testing Your Deployment

### Test MCP Server:
```bash
curl https://agent-mcp-production.up.railway.app/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "server": "agent-mcp-sse",
  "agents": ["react-expert", "sql-debugger"],
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T..."
}
```

### Test Installer:
```bash
curl https://jboal1.github.io/agent-mcp/install.sh | head -20
```

Should show the install script.

### Test End-to-End:
Run the installer on a different machine:
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://jboal1.github.io/agent-mcp/install.sh)
```

Then in Claude Code, try:
```
/react-expert Create a Button component
/sql-debug SELECT * FROM users
/agents
```

## Troubleshooting

### Railway Issues
```bash
# View logs
railway logs

# Restart service
railway restart

# Check status
railway status
```

### GitHub Pages Not Loading
- Wait 2-3 minutes after push
- Check: https://github.com/jboal1/agent-mcp/settings/pages
- Verify build status in Actions tab

### Install Script Fails
- Make sure user has Claude Code installed
- Check MCP server is responding: `curl https://agent-mcp-production.up.railway.app/health`
- Verify install.sh has correct Railway URL

### Hacker News
```
Show HN: AI Agent MCP Server with One-Line Installer

I built a production-ready Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that anyone can install with a single bash command. It adds AI agents (React expert, SQL debugger) to Claude Code.

Tech stack:
- Anthropic MCP SDK for agent runtime
- Railway for hosting (free tier)
- GitHub Pages for installer distribution
- SSE transport for real-time streaming

Try it: bash <(curl -fsSL https://jboal1.github.io/agent-mcp/install.sh)

Code: https://github.com/jboal1/agent-mcp
```

## What You Learned

✅ MCP protocol and SSE transport
✅ Railway deployment and configuration
✅ GitHub Pages for static file hosting
✅ Bash installer scripting
✅ AI agent YAML blueprints
✅ Prompt injection guardrails
✅ Production Node.js builds
✅ One-line distribution pattern

---

## You're Now Production Ready! 🎉

Your MCP server is:
- ✅ Live and accessible worldwide
- ✅ Auto-scaling on Railway
- ✅ Installable in one command
- ✅ Free to run (under limits)
- ✅ Easy to update (just git push)

**Go share it with the world!** 🚀
