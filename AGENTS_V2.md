# ðŸŽ‰ Agent MCP v2 - Enhanced UX

## What's New

### 3 New Agents
1. **`/git-helper`** - Git expert
   - Commands, workflows, conflict resolution
   - Undo commits, merge strategies, best practices

2. **`/debug-this`** - Error analyzer
   - Paste any error message, get solutions
   - Identifies root causes, suggests fixes
   - Works across all languages

3. **`/test-gen`** - Test generator
   - Generates unit tests, integration tests
   - Creates test fixtures and mock data
   - Covers edge cases automatically

### Major UX Improvements

#### 1. `/help` Command
Shows all available agents with examples and use cases
```
/help
```

#### 2. Examples Subcommand
Every agent now has an `examples` mode:
```
/react-expert examples
/sql-debug examples
/git-helper examples
/debug-this examples
/test-gen examples
```

#### 3. Better Discoverability
- Clearer argument hints in autocomplete
- Inline examples in slash command prompts
- Context-aware help messages
