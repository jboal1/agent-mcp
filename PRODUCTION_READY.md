   - Proper error handling
   - Beautiful CLI output
   - Auto-configures everything

2. **MCP Server** (Already running)
   - SSE transport on port 3002
   - 2 agents: react-expert, sql-debugger
   - Guardrails for prompt protection
   - Slash command support

3. **Git Repository**
   - Initialized and ready
   - README.md with full documentation
   - .gitignore configured
   - Deploy guide included

## 🚀 Next Steps (Choose Your Path)

### Path A: Quick Deploy (5 minutes)

Use ngrok for now, deploy properly later:

```bash
# Already working!
bash <(curl -fsSL https://julien-semimanneristic-eugene.ngrok-free.dev/install)
```

Share this with friends today.

### Path B: GitHub Pages (15 minutes)

Host install script on GitHub Pages:

```bash
# 1. Create GitHub repo
gh repo create agent-mcp --public --source=. --remote=origin --push

# 2. Enable Pages
gh repo edit --enable-pages --pages-branch main --pages-path /

# 3. Wait 1-2 minutes, then share:
bash <(curl -fsSL https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/agent-mcp/install.sh)
```

### Path C: Production (1-2 hours)

Full production setup:

1. **Get a domain** ($12/year)
   - agent-mcp.dev
   - Or use GitHub Pages subdomain (free)

2. **Deploy MCP server** (free tier)
   - Railway.app (recommended)
   - Render.com
   - Fly.io

3. **Update install script** with production URL

4. **Share the one-liner:**
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -fsSL https://agent-mcp.dev/install.sh)
   ```
